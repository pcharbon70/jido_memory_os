# Phase 2 - Tiered Memory and Lifecycle

Back to index: [README](./README.md)

## Relevant Shared APIs / Interfaces
- `Jido.MemoryOS.MemoryManager`
- `Jido.MemoryOS.Query`
- `Record.metadata["mem_os"]`

## Relevant Assumptions / Defaults
- Namespace format defaults to `agent:<id>:short|mid|long`.
- Retrieval defaults to hybrid ranking (semantic optional fallback to lexical).
